Hi there, I'm c4605 :)

* I'm currently working as a front-end engineer
* I'm learning Rust
* I have some knowledge of ClojureScript, Bash, Python, Ruby, MySQL, Ansible, and iOS development :P
* I'm using Emacs ([My emacs config](https://github.com/bolasblack/.emacsrc)) and Nix (my [nix config](https://github.com/bolasblack/dotfiles/tree/master/nix) and my [nix overlay](https://github.com/bolasblack/nix-overlay))

## Interesting projects

### [http-api-guide](https://github.com/bolasblack/http-api-guide)
A comprehensive HTTP API design guide written in Chinese. Covers RESTful principles, error handling, versioning strategies, and best practices for building maintainable APIs.

### [effect-saga](https://github.com/bolasblack/effect-saga)
A [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) implementation using the [Effect](https://effect.website/) library. Combines redux-saga's elegant patterns with Effect's type-safe error tracking, dependency injection, and functional programming primitives.

### [btc-utils](https://github.com/bolasblack/btc-utils)
Bitcoin transaction utilities for TypeScript. Provides zero-dependency helpers for estimating transaction vSize before signing and calculating dust thresholds. Designed to be easy to read and understand with clear documentation links.

### [programr](https://github.com/bolasblack/programr)
A Ruby interpreter for AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language), originally forked but extensively rewritten. AIML is an XML-based language for creating chatbots and conversational AI agents, making it an interesting exploration of early chatbot technologies.

### [@c4/use-effect-reducer](https://github.com/bolasblack/react-components/tree/develop/packages/useEffectReducer)
A React hook that brings Elm's elegant TEA pattern to React. Reducers return `[nextState, effect]` instead of just state, making side effects declarative and event-driven rather than state-driven. This eliminates `useEffect` dependency tracking entirely—effects are explicitly tied to actions, not derived from watching state changes. The result is pure, testable reducer logic with effects as first-class values.

## State Management & Data Flow

* [yarw](https://github.com/bolasblack/js-metarepo/tree/develop/packages/yarw): A typesafe, effective Redux wrapper that simplifies Redux boilerplate while maintaining type safety.

## React Components & Hooks

* [@c4605/react-modal](https://github.com/bolasblack/react-components/blob/master/packages/Modal/README.mdx): A lightweight modal component with a convenient `useModal` hook.
* [@c4/use-async](https://github.com/bolasblack/react-components/tree/develop/packages/useAsync): Type-safe async function helper hook for managing loading states and errors.

## Build Tools & Developer Experience

* [babel-plugin-jsx-wrapper](https://github.com/bolasblack/babel-plugin-jsx-wrapper): Enhanced Babel plugin that automatically wraps JSX components with observer decorators (MobX, Realar, etc.). Adds ES module support, custom decorators, displayName, and React.memo integration - significantly reduces boilerplate code.
* [git-hook-pure](https://github.com/bolasblack/git-hook-pure): A lightweight [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) alternative written in pure Shell for faster git hook management.
* [@c4/g](https://github.com/bolasblack/c4g): Custom schematics (code generators) built on Angular CLI's scaffolding system for rapid project setup.
* [module-mapper-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/bolasblack/module-mapper-webpack-plugin): Dynamically replace module paths at build time for flexible dependency management.
* [interpolate-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/bolasblack/interpolate-webpack-plugin): Inject predefined variables into your built assets for environment-specific configurations.
