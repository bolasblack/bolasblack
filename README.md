# My Works

Here is a list of some of the work I did.

## Webpack Plugins

* [module-mapper-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/bolasblack/module-mapper-webpack-plugin): A webpack plugin to replace module path.
* [interpolate-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/bolasblack/interpolate-webpack-plugin): Interpolate predefined variables to assets files.

## React

- [DocumentElement](https://github.com/bolasblack/react-components/blob/master/packages/DocumentElement/README.mdx): Provides a declarative way to specify `document.documentElement` attributes in a single-page app.
- [Portal](https://github.com/bolasblack/react-components/blob/master/packages/Portal/README.mdx): Strong enough [`React.createPortal`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#createportal) replacement. Make most `React.createPortal` use case more easier.
- [Popover](https://github.com/bolasblack/react-components/blob/master/packages/packages/Popover/README.mdx): Powerful and highly customizable popover component, can adapt to most use case.
- [Modal](https://github.com/bolasblack/react-components/blob/master/packages/packages/Modal/README.mdx): A simple modal component. Provide react hook `useModal`.

## Other

* [git-hook-pure](https://github.com/bolasblack/git-hook-pure): A simple [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) replacement written in Shell (so it can be faster in some case).
* [vue-tsx-starter](https://github.com/bolasblack/vue-tsx-starter): Write vue and enjoy the benefits of tsx. (Some dependencies out of date).
* [ts-types](https://github.com/bolasblack/ts-types): Some type helper for TypeScript.
* [@c4/g](https://github.com/bolasblack/c4g): Some schematics (A generic scaffolding library for the modern web. A part of [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/)) I wrote.
