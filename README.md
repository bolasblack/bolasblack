Hi there, I'm c4605 :)

- I'm currently working as a front-end engineer
- I'm learning Rust
- I have some knowledge of ClojureScript, Bash, Python, Ruby, MySQL, Ansible, and iOS development :P
- I'm using Emacs ([My emacs config](https://github.com/bolasblack/.emacsrc)) and Nix (my [nix config](https://github.com/bolasblack/dotfiles/tree/master/nix) and my [nix overlay](https://github.com/bolasblack/nix-overlay))

## Interesting projects

### [http-api-guide](https://github.com/bolasblack/http-api-guide)

A comprehensive HTTP API design guide written in Chinese. Covers RESTful principles, error handling, versioning strategies, and best practices for building maintainable APIs.

### [effect-saga](https://github.com/bolasblack/effect-saga)

A demonstration of [Effect](https://effect.website/)'s powerful capabilities by reimplementing [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)'s core patterns with remarkably simple code. Shows how Effect's built-in primitives (Fiber, Queue, Deferred) make complex async orchestration effortless—what takes redux-saga hundreds of lines becomes concise and type-safe with Effect's functional programming foundation.

### [btc-utils](https://github.com/bolasblack/btc-utils)

Bitcoin transaction utilities for TypeScript. Provides zero-dependency helpers for estimating transaction vSize before signing and calculating dust thresholds. Designed to be easy to read and understand with clear documentation links.

### [programr](https://github.com/bolasblack/programr)

A Ruby interpreter for AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language), originally forked but extensively rewritten. AIML is an XML-based language for creating chatbots and conversational AI agents, making it an interesting exploration of early chatbot technologies.

### [@c4/use-effect-reducer](https://github.com/bolasblack/react-components/tree/develop/packages/useEffectReducer)

A showcase of [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) architecture's elegance in handling complex interactions. By adopting Elm's [TEA (The Elm Architecture)](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) pattern where reducers return `[nextState, effect]`, this hook demonstrates how naturally difficult state machines and async flows become when effects are event-driven rather than state-driven. Eliminates `useEffect` dependency tracking entirely—complex UI interactions that typically require careful effect orchestration become simple, declarative action-effect pairs.

## Blockchain

- [bitcoin-wallet-connector](https://github.com/bolasblack/bitcoin-wallet-connector): A unified interface for interacting with multiple Bitcoin wallet browser extensions (Unisat, Xverse, OKX, Leather, Bitget, Magic Eden). Features security-first architecture and restrained API design.

## State Management & Data Flow

- [yarw](https://github.com/bolasblack/js-metarepo/tree/develop/packages/yarw): A typesafe, effective Redux wrapper that simplifies Redux boilerplate while maintaining type safety.

## React Components & Hooks

- [@c4605/react-modal](https://github.com/bolasblack/react-components/blob/master/packages/Modal/README.mdx): A lightweight modal component with a convenient `useModal` hook.
- [@c4/use-async](https://github.com/bolasblack/react-components/tree/develop/packages/useAsync): Type-safe async function helper hook for managing loading states and errors.

## Build Tools & Developer Experience

- [shadow-cljs-vite-plugin](https://github.com/bolasblack/shadow-cljs-vite-plugin): A Vite plugin for [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) that provides seamless integration and a better developer experience.
- [git-hook-pure](https://github.com/bolasblack/git-hook-pure): A lightweight [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) alternative written in pure Shell for faster git hook management.
- [@c4/g](https://github.com/bolasblack/c4g): Custom schematics (code generators) built on Angular CLI's scaffolding system for rapid project setup.
- [babel-plugin-jsx-wrapper](https://github.com/bolasblack/babel-plugin-jsx-wrapper): Enhanced Babel plugin that automatically wraps JSX components with observer decorators (MobX, Realar, etc.). Adds ES module support, custom decorators, displayName, and React.memo integration - significantly reduces boilerplate code.
- [module-mapper-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/bolasblack/module-mapper-webpack-plugin): Dynamically replace module paths at build time for flexible dependency management.
- [interpolate-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/bolasblack/interpolate-webpack-plugin): Inject predefined variables into your built assets for environment-specific configurations.
